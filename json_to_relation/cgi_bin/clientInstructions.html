The main table file will include 'EventXtract' in its name. Each
of its rows contains one 'event,' a student's interaction with
the OpenEdX learning platform. The table file that includes 
'VideoInteraction' excerpts rows from the EventXtract table 
that are video related. Similarly, rows in the table file
that contains the name 'ActivityGrade' excerpts all the
assignment related rows from EventXtract. These two tables
are conveniences.
